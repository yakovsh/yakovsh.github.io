<p>I recently ran across <a href="http://navalny-en.livejournal.com/93703.html" target="_blank">this blog post</a> which mentions a very curious observation - people who are in power aren't smarter or more well informed than those below them. To quote:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>But first, the three important things you must know when trying to analyze any actions of the government.</em></p>
<p><em>1. Within the government reign disorder and chaos. 90% of political decisions are the result of accident, coincidence, or spontaneous decisions influenced by short-term situations. Here I’m speaking not only of Russia’s government but of any government; just read any politicians’ memoirs, they describe it very well.</em></p>
<p><em>2. People in the Kremlin [i.e. government] are neither superior to you intellectually, nor better informed.</em></p>
<p><em>3. If you read just two trustworthy papers every morning and follow 2 to 5 more or less independent TV stations and news websites, and several journalists are on your Twitter reading list, then your level of awareness is just as good as Putin’s [the President of Russia].</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The same applies to CEOs, religious leaders and others.</p>
