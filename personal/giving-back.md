I try to give back to the community around me whenever I can. Currently, I do the following:

- Assist non-profits with technology needs
- Help nanage websites of [several](http://www.koyb.org/) [non-profit](https://hebrewbooks.org/) organizations
- [Mentor](https://www.tjenetwork.com/) people who want to start new businesses
- Serve as an advisor to [a local congregation](http://www.koyb.org/)
- Serve a technical adviser to [a non-profit digitizing books](http://www.hebrewbooks.org/)
- Volunteer and serve as a board member in [a local group of professionals](http://www.jet-tech.org/) helping people finding jobs

I also try to contribute to open source projects as well as open sourcing my own code.
