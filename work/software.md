Most of my daily work involves software engineering in some sort or fashion. I have worked on library automation software, [CRM software](https://www.solidmatrix.com/) for field service, [visual SQL tools](http://www.biofortis.com/products/qiagram/) for making interactions with databases easier, and most recently [mobile apps](https://www.noom.com/) to help people get healthier.

All of my side projects can be found at [my consulting company’s website](http://www.shaftek.biz). Open source stuff is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/yakovsh).
