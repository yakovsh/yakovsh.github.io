<p>For the past year or so, I have noticed a lot of new public domain books appearing in Amazon under <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26field-language%3D%26field-title%3D%26field-binding_browse-bin%3D%26Adv-Srch-Books-Submit.y%3D0%26node%3D%26field-dateyear%3D%26field-publisher%3Dnabu%2520press%26redirect%3Dtrue%26sort%3Drelevanceexprank%26search-alias%3Dstripbooks%26field-isbn%3D%26ref%5F%3Dsr%5Fadv%5Fb%26unfiltered%3D1%26field-p%5Fn%5Fcondition-type%3D%26field-feature%5Fbrowse-bin%3D%26field-subject%3D%26Adv-Srch-Books-Submit.x%3D0%26field-datemod%3D%26field-dateop%3D%26field-keywords%3D%26field-author%3D&amp;tag=pdreprints-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Nabu Press</a>. They seem to have no website and their books do not have any contact information. Yet, they keep pumping out public domain reprints to a tune of over <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26field-language%3D%26field-title%3D%26field-binding_browse-bin%3D%26Adv-Srch-Books-Submit.y%3D0%26node%3D%26field-dateyear%3D%26field-publisher%3Dnabu%2520press%26redirect%3Dtrue%26sort%3Drelevanceexprank%26search-alias%3Dstripbooks%26field-isbn%3D%26ref%5F%3Dsr%5Fadv%5Fb%26unfiltered%3D1%26field-p%5Fn%5Fcondition-type%3D%26field-feature%5Fbrowse-bin%3D%26field-subject%3D%26Adv-Srch-Books-Submit.x%3D0%26field-datemod%3D%26field-dateop%3D%26field-keywords%3D%26field-author%3D&amp;tag=pdreprints-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">600,000</a> titles so far.</p>
<p>I took some time to check various state corporation databases and actually managed to find who Nabu Press is. They are ... <a href="http://www.bibliobazaar.com/aboutus.php">BiblioBazaar</a> / <a href="http://bibliolife.com/">BiblioLife</a>, a company started by former BookSurge partners after they sold their POD company to Amazon. It is no surprise that they print their POD books through Amazon.</p>
<p>How do I know this - take a look at <a href="http://www.scsos.com/index.asp?n=18&amp;p=4&amp;s=18&amp;corporateid=567536">the SC filing for Nabu Press LLC</a>. The registered agent is for Nabu is:</p>
<blockquote><p>ERIKA V. HARRISON<br />
18-A CAROLINA<br />
CHARLESTON, SC 29403</p></blockquote>
<p>A search of the same site, reveals that only two other corporations have the same registered agent - <a href="http://www.scsos.com/index.asp?n=18&amp;p=4&amp;s=18&amp;corporateid=520341">BIBLIOBAZAAR II, LLC</a> and <a href="http://www.scsos.com/index.asp?n=18&amp;p=4&amp;s=18&amp;corporateid=520341">BIBLIOLABS, LLC</a>. BiblioLabs is part of BiblioBazaar as stated <a href="http://bibliolabs.bibliolife.com/">on their website</a>.</p>
<p>So the final word is that Nabu Press is actually part of BiblioBazaar. HOWEVER, why did they NOT mention this on their website, and especially in <a href="http://bibliolabs.bibliolife.com/programs-and-imprints/">the list of their imprints here</a>? Could it be for legal reasons?</p>
