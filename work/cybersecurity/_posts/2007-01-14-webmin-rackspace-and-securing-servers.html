<p>Last week <a href="http://www.solidmatrix.com">my company</a> was making some server changes which necessitates a security check. Being a start-up, we cannot afford a format ethical hack/penetration testing, so the next best thing is an automated security tool. I tried using <a href="http://www.nessus.org/">Nessus</a> from Windows, but it failed miserably. Upon recommendation from <a href="http://www.vesaria.com">a friend in the security field</a>, we decided to try out automated testing services offered by <a href="http://www.qualys.com/">Qualys</a> (a review is forthcoming).</p>
<p>Surprisingly enough, when we ran the test, we found a very severy security hole in an unexpected place - <a href="http://www.webmin.com">Webmin</a> running on this server. Now it turns out that Webmin is well known for having common security issues (see <a href="http://www.webmin.com/security.html">their security page</a>). My suprise was not the security flaw, but rather that we were running an old unpatched version. I promptly called our host, which is <a href="http://www.rackspace.com">Rackspace</a> to ask them what happened. Since day one when we switched to them, our server updates the OS on a daily basis, specifically avoiding this scenario. Additionally, we did not install Webmin on the server - rather Rackspace did before they provisioned it.</p>
<p>Guess what they told me? Since the specific OS that we used does not include Webmin in their official package list, the version of Webmin that they install is a custom package they make by hand. And the worst part - <strong>THEY DO NOT UPDATE IT AUTOMATICALLY</strong>, nor do they even have a central repository for this kind of stuff - each technician builds the packages themselves. Being that we are paying through the nose for their hosting and support, this was a jarring piece of news, especially considering that this hole has been there for over a year and could have severely compromised our server and by extensions our business.</p>
<p>So the bottom line - don't trust your host with everything. And if you are using Rackspace, do ask them about their custom packages and RPMs, especially on enterprise Linuxes such as <a href="http://wideopen.com/rhel/">RHEL</a> since Webmin is installed by default.</p>
<p>P.S. A different solution that was suggested to me is to make Webmin check for updates itself on a regular basis. The only issue we have with that is the fact that I am not sure if it checks the digital signatures.</p>
<p>P.P.S. Another solution is to close off Webmin all together to the outside and use SSH tunnelling. A bit more complicated but a lot more secure.</p>
