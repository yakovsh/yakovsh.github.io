<p>With a slew of hijacked and compromised Gmail accounts from people I know, I started thinking about an easy way to protect yourself from it. I did come up with a free but not so simple solution:</p>
<p>1. Sign up for the free <a href="http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/group/index.html">Google Apps for Domain</a> package.</p>
<p>2. Create a special user for administrating the domain whose password and reset credentials are different from your regular ones. Make sure that the secondary email address points somewhere else like your phone (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_SMS_gateways">see here</a> for a list of SMS gateways).</p>
<p>3. Setup your regular account and make sure NOT TO GIVE IT domain admin privileges or same password.</p>
<p>4. If you account gets hijacked or compromised, whip out the special domain administrator account, login and reset your regular account password.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Of course, don't forget backup services like <a href="http://www.backupify.com">Backupify</a>.</p>
