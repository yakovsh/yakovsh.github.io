From [today’s headlines](http://it.slashdot.org/story/10/10/04/2121232/Comcast-Warns-Customers-Suspected-of-Bot-Infection):

> *“Comcast is pushing a new program nationwide that [warns customers if they might have a bot infection](http://krebsonsecurity.com/2010/10/comcast-pushes-bot-alert-program-nationwide/). It puts a semitransparent overlay on the top of the website you’re viewing, warning you that you may have a bot installed if the provider detects botnet traffic from your residence.*

From [a post by Carl Hutzler](http://www.circleid.com/posts/how_to_stop_spam/), AOL’s postmaster (via John Levine), from 2005 (five years ago):

> Filters and blocklists are **band aids**.They do nothing to solve the problem.

> Messaging Providers taking responsibility when their networks are commandeered to send spam is the **solution**.

Looks like some ISPs are finally waking up to that
