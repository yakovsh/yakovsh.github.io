<p>Going over <a href="http://www.imc.org/ietf-mxcomp/mail-archive/msg03497.html">Microsoft's FAQ</a> on their new Sender-ID license, I noticed the following statement:</p>
<p><cite>The original CallerID patent application was filed long before Microsoft made a decision to contribute its CallerID specification to the IETF</cite></p>
<p>The original Caller ID specification was submitted to the IETF sometime around the Spring of 2004, after the MARID WG formed. "Was filed long before" sounds like a pretty long times, however the facts are pointing in a different direction.</p>
<p>Bob Atkinson is listed as a main author of <a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-atkinson-callerid-00.txt">the Caller ID</a> draft. Yet in May of 2003 he <a href="http://www1.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/asrg/current/msg04333.html">was asking</a> questions about <a href="//www.danisch.de/work/security/antispam.html)">RMX</a> which surely did not sound like he was well versed in email.</p>
<p>Draw your own conclusions.</p>
