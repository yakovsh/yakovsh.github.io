<p>After struggling to find WPA2 drivers for the Microsoft Wireless PCMCIA adaptor (MN-520) for a newly rebuilt laptop, I decided to post instructions as to where to find them. Especially, since this product has been discontinued by Microsoft and for some obscure reason removed them from Windows Update.</p>
<p>Anyway, to install the drivers you need to install <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=33104">original Microsoft Broadband Networking Software</a> from Microsoft, and then <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=6790">the updated version</a> with WPA2 support. As a third step, you also need <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?id=893357">the WPA2 update for Microsoft Windows XP</a> (you do need a genuine copy of Windows for step 3).</p>
<p>More information can be found <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/814445">here</a> and <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?id=893357">here</a>.</p>
